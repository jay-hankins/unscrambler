 * Original Contest Problem:
 * You have ten Scrabble
 * tiles with the letters A E F G I L M N O S in that
 * order. Your task is to shuffle them around to obtain a ten-letter English word (there
 * is only one). However, you are only allowed two types of manipulation: you can shift
 * the first letter to the last position, and you can pick the letters in odd positions (in
 * order) followed by the letters in even positions (in order). Thus, starting with the
 * letters in alphabetic order, you can reach E F G I L M N O S A , and A
 * F I M O E G L N S . What is the shortest sequence of moves needed to
 * complete the task?

 * This Java program outputs the number position result of the word "flamingoes," the only 
 * 10-letter English word than can be spelled from the given letters, by performing the 
 * operations like a recursion tree (see diagram). 
 * Note: This program does not output the number of "tries" or "moves" to get to 
 * "flamingoes." I will explain the logic behind deducing the number of moves from the position by hand.
