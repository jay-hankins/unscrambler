unscrambler
===========

This Java program was created to unscramble the word "flamingoes" for the 2014 IUPUI High School Math Contest.

Original Contest Problem:
<blockquote>You have ten Scrabble tiles with the letters A E F G I L M N O S in that
order. Your task is to shuffle them around to obtain a ten-letter English word (there
is only one). However, you are only allowed two types of manipulation: you can shift
the first letter to the last position, and you can pick the letters in odd positions (in
order) followed by the letters in even positions (in order). Thus, starting with the
letters in alphabetic order, you can reach E F G I L M N O S A , and A
F I M O E G L N S . What is the shortest sequence of moves needed to
complete the task?</blockquote>
